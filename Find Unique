Question -->
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N. Where N is equal to [2M + 1].
Now, in the given array/list, 'M' numbers are present twice and one number is present only once.
ou need to find and return that number which is unique in the array/list.
Note --->  Unique element is always present in the array/list according to the given condition.


Sample input -->
1
7
2 3 1 6 3 6 2

Sample output -->
1  -- is the unique element


Solution -->
#include <iostream> 

using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int arr[100] = {2,3,1,6,3,6,2};
  int size = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(int);     // to know the size of the array
  
  int ans = 0;
  
  for(int i = 0; i<size; i++)
  {
    ans = ans ^ arr[i];               //performing the xor operation
  }
  
  cout<<ans<endl;
  return 0;
}
